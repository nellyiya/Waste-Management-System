Introduction
The Smart Waste Management System, named WasteXpert, allows users to manage waste collection schedules, track recycling efforts, and view environmental impact metrics. The system supports three primary user roles: Household Users, Waste Collection Services, and Administrators.

Project Inception
The project began with the recognition of the need for a more efficient and user-friendly waste management system. Traditional waste management systems often lack transparency, user engagement, and efficient scheduling. WasteXpert aims to address these gaps by leveraging modern web technologies.
